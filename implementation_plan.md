### **Project: Checklist Feature Backend Implementation**

**Objective:** To build the backend services required to support the checklist functionality as seen in `frontend/src/pages/checklist/ChecklistPage/ChecklistPage.jsx`. This involves creating the database schema, API endpoints for CRUD operations, and ensuring data is correctly associated with the authenticated user.

---

### **Phase 1: Database Layer Setup**

**Goal:** Establish the database foundation for the checklist feature by defining the data models and applying the schema changes to the database.

*   **Task 1.1: Create SQLAlchemy Models**
    *   **Description:** Define the SQLAlchemy ORM models based on the provided schema for `Checklists`, `Categories`, `Items`, and `UploadedFiles`. This includes setting up columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships (`db.relationship`) to link the models together (e.g., a checklist has many categories).
    *   **File to Create:** `backend/app/db/models/checklist.py`
    *   **Context:** These models are the Python representation of our database tables. The ORM allows us to interact with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL, which is consistent with the existing `user.py` model. The relationships defined here are crucial for SQLAlchemy to understand how to join tables and cascade operations.
    *   **Status:** `Completed`

*   **Task 1.2: Generate Database Migration**
    *   **Description:** Use the `flask db migrate` command to automatically generate a new Alembic migration script. This script will contain the necessary `CREATE TABLE` statements to apply the new schema to the database.
    *   **File to be Generated:** `backend/migrations/versions/<hash>_add_checklist_tables.py`
    *   **Context:** Database migrations allow us to version-control our database schema. Instead of applying SQL changes manually, we use Alembic to create repeatable scripts. This ensures that the schema can be upgraded (and downgraded) reliably across different environments (development, testing, production). This is the standard practice in this project, as seen from the initial migration file.
    *   **Status:** `Completed`

### **Phase 2: API and Business Logic Layer**

**Goal:** Expose the database functionality through a secure and well-defined REST API. This involves creating schemas for data validation and serialization, and building the API endpoints.

**Developer Context:** Before starting, it is crucial to understand the existing patterns in the codebase to ensure consistency.
*   **For Schemas (Task 2.1):** Review `backend/app/schemas/user.py` and `backend/app/schemas/auth.py`. These files demonstrate how Marshmallow is used for data validation and serialization. The new schemas in `backend/app/schemas/checklist.py` should follow the established pattern.
*   **For Routes (Task 2.2):** Examine the Flask Blueprint implementation in `backend/app/api/auth/routes.py`. The new checklist functionality should be organized within its own blueprint in a new `backend/app/api/checklists/` directory.
*   **Security Model:** All new API endpoints must be protected. Refer to existing routes for the correct implementation of `@jwt_required()` to secure endpoints and `get_jwt_identity()` to scope database queries, ensuring users can only access their own data.

*   **Task 2.1: Create Marshmallow Schemas**
    *   **Description:** Create Marshmallow schemas for each of the new models (`ChecklistSchema`, `CategorySchema`, `ItemSchema`, `UploadedFileSchema`). These schemas will be used for validating incoming request data (e.g., from a POST request) and for serializing data sent back in responses (converting Python objects to JSON).
    *   **File to Create:** `backend/app/schemas/checklist.py`
    *   **Context:** Schemas decouple the database representation from the API representation. They provide a robust way to ensure that data coming into our API is valid and that data going out has the expected format. This follows the pattern established by `user.py` and `auth.py` in the `schemas` directory.
    *   **Status:** `Pending`

*   **Task 2.2: Create Checklist Blueprint and Routes**
    *   **Description:** Create a new Flask Blueprint to group all checklist-related routes. Implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for all the models. Routes should be nested logically (e.g., `/api/checklists/<checklist_id>/categories`). All endpoints must be protected with `@jwt_required()` and should be scoped to the current user (`get_jwt_identity()`) to prevent users from accessing or modifying other users' data.
    *   **File to Create:** `backend/app/api/checklists/routes.py`
    *   **Context:** Blueprints help organize a Flask application into logical components, which is the pattern used in the existing `auth` and `users` APIs. The routes will provide the HTTP interface for the frontend to interact with the backend. User-scoping is a critical security requirement.
    *   **Status:** `Pending`

*   **Task 2.3: Implement File Upload Logic**
    *   **Description:** Implement the endpoint for handling file uploads. This will involve receiving a file, securely saving it (e.g., to a local folder or a cloud storage service), and creating a corresponding `UploadedFiles` record in the database linked to the correct `Item`.
    *   **File to Modify:** `backend/app/api/checklists/routes.py`
    *   **Context:** The `ChecklistPage.jsx` component has functionality for uploading files. This backend endpoint will provide the necessary service to handle these uploads, store the files, and track them in the database.
    *   **Status:** `Pending`

---

### **Phase 3: Integration**

**Goal:** Integrate the new checklist feature into the main Flask application.

*   **Task 3.1: Register Blueprint**
    *   **Description:** Import and register the newly created checklist blueprint with the main Flask `app` instance inside the `create_app` factory function.
    *   **File to Modify:** `backend/app/__init__.py`
    *   **Context:** Registering the blueprint makes its routes and error handlers active within the application, allowing them to receive requests. Without this step, the API endpoints would not be accessible.
    *   **Status:** `Pending`

---

### **Phase 4: Testing (Recommended)**

**Goal:** Ensure the new feature is working correctly and is free of bugs.

*   **Task 4.1: Write Tests**
    *   **Description:** Create unit tests for the new models and integration tests for the API endpoints. Tests should cover successful cases (e.g., creating a checklist), edge cases (e.g., invalid input), and security (e.g., a user trying to access another user's checklist).
    *   **File to Create:** `backend/tests/test_checklists.py`
    *   **Context:** Automated tests are crucial for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions. Following the existing testing structure in the `tests/` directory will ensure consistency.
    *   **Status:** `Pending`
